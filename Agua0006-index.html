            <p>I originally applied to the Graphic Design program back in 2022 purely out of
            curiosity and a love for designing. I didn’t end up doing well and only completed one
            semester. In 2024 I knew I wanted to finally complete a program all the way through, so I
            reapplied and am doing so much better this time around. I am even more inspired and in
            love with the program. The only thing that has changed from when I first applied in 2022, is
            my grades, which are SO much better, and I am incredibly proud of myself after looking and
            reflecting my previous grades. At this point my strongest asset as a designer is my sharp
            eyes, I notice very tiny details that older Graphic Designers may look over. I will continue to
            bring this asset into the industry with me.</p>
